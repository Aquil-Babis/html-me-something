        <h2><b><cite>Odd Billy Todd</cite></b> by N. C. Reed</h2>
        <p>  Odd Billy Todd is a postapocalyptic fiction novel which follows the story of Billy Todd and his attempts to make a life for himself after a new, fast spreading, disease wipes out 95% of human life.
            This novel portrays what seems to be a realistic interperetation of what life would be like at the end of the world.  While many books of similar subjects focus on the conflict between survivors this
            book focuses more on the conflict against the environment. I would strongly recommend this novel as one of the best novels I have read from the genre of postapocalyptic fiction.

        <h2><b><cite>The Sam Gunn Omnibus</cite></b> by Ben Bova</h2>
        <p>  The Sam Gunn Omnibus is a collection of short stories taking place during the years of mankinds expansion into space.  As the title would indicate, these stories all follow the adventures of Sam Gunn,
        an free-spirited entrepreneur who is a space aged mix between P.T. Barnum and Huckleberry Finn.  The collection of stories are presented to the reader from the point of view of a journalist scowering the
        solar system for first hand accounts of Sam wherever they might be found.  While not quite chronological in order, the stories are all highly enjoyable and fit well in the format presented.  A great choice 
        for anyone who can appreciate a good near future sci-fi story.

        <h2><b><cite>Dungeon Born</cite></b> by Dakota Krout</h2>
        <p>  Dungeon Born is the first book in a five book series in the LitRPG genre.  The story is divided between the dungeon core Cal, who is striving towards perfection as a dungeon core, and the sheep-herder 
            Dale, who is striving to make a new life for himself as an adventurer after being the one to discover a newborn dungeon.  Both struggle to overcome the greed and ambition from the Adventurer's Guild and 
            a mysterious group working behind the scenes.  This author does extremely well to seamlessly work the skill progression, which is a staple within the LitRPG genre, into their books so that the system 
            is clear yet not rigidly layed out as stat sheets.  This series would be an excellent choice for anyone curious about the LitRPG genre.
